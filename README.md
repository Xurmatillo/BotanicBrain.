Creating a 100% autonomous smart gardener project using neural network and Arduino platform can be a challenging but rewarding project. In this project, you will be using the Arduino platform to gather sensor data from your garden, and then using a neural network to analyze that data and make decisions about when to water your plants, adjust lighting conditions, and other tasks.

Here are the steps you can follow to create your own smart gardener project:

Collect data: First, you need to collect data on the environment in your garden. You can use a range of sensors such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, soil moisture sensors, light sensors, etc. to collect this data. Use the Arduino platform to record this data and store it for later analysis.

Build the Neural Network: You can use a pre-trained neural network model such as TensorFlow or build your own custom neural network using libraries such as Keras or PyTorch. Once you have the neural network set up, you will need to train it using the data you collected from your garden. This training will allow the neural network to learn patterns in the data and make predictions about when your plants need water or other conditions need adjustment.

Connect to the Arduino platform: Once your neural network is trained, you will need to connect it to the Arduino platform so that it can receive input data from the sensors and send commands to the actuators. You can use an interface such as a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module to make this connection.

Control the garden environment: Finally, you will need to program the Arduino platform to act on the decisions made by the neural network. This might involve turning on or off watering systems, adjusting lighting conditions, and so on.
